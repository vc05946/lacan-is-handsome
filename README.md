As I said, I am a Lacanian. So it is a must to have some notes on Lacan. I hope I can read through Écrits and all seminars. I know this sounds crazy. But I think this is a must for a serious study on Lacan.

I love Shen as he is the one who can elaborate on Lacan's theory most clearly and interestingly in Chinese.
